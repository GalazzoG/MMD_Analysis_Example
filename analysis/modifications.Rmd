### Modification to the original report

The original report contained an extensive set of analyses intended to investigate the effect of nutrition on metabolic health and clinical phenotypes. 
These analysis used proprietary scripts and functions as well as custom indexes which could not be shared.
It has been reduced in size to protect the company's IP and to meet the interview requirements. 

### Modification to the original dataset

For the same reasons, the dataset has been limited to the smallest necessary size that still allows for the analysis to be conducted effectively.
As additional protection, new, random subjects IDs were created and the clinical group labels randomly shuffled.
